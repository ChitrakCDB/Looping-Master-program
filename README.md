# Looping-Master-program
In this program we will be able to print a spiral square  matrix of n number. 

First of all take any matrix let us take 4 X 4 matrix

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16

This is the 4 X 4 matrix so our out put must be like

 1 2 3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10 9 8 7


So for this we have to give a particular position to every single elements
Like a11 a12 a13 and so on.... 

In this program I've used
Round() and ceil() functions to round up the value 
For ex: the value is 4.5 it'll be considered as 4.

After this I've used for loops to print the outer elements of the matrix
And count is initially 1 and will gradually increase when the loops and the conditions is satisfied and increment operators starts working



And after the looping process I've printed the array and the 
Spiral square matrix output is produced. 

round( ) function in C returns the nearest integer value of the float/double/long double argument passed to this function.

If decimal value is from ”.1 to .5″, it returns integer value less than the argument. If decimal value is from “.6 to .9″, it returns the integer value greater than the argument.

”math.h” header file supports round( ) function in C language. Syntax for round( ) function in C is given below.

double round (double a);

float roundf (float a);

long double roundl (long double a);


ceil ( )	
This function returns nearest integer 
value which is greater than or equal
to the argument passed to this function

Note: The include_master prog is the word file for the same program given in
N * N spiral matrix


Thank you!
